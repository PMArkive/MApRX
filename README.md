# MApRX
![Hello I'm MARX without 'p'](https://github.com/wwylele/MApRX/master/src/MApRX_Qt/image/LICON.png)
MApRX is a map editor for Kirby Super Star Ultra. It is written in C++ and powered by Qt. It is just at the beginning, with lots of uncompleted staff. Welcome to contribute to this project!

MApRX is licensed under the GPLv3 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.

## How to build
Open `/src/MApRX_Qt/MApRX_Qt.pro` with Qt Creater, and set the building path (you can set it to `/bin/` since it is ignored by `.gitignore`). Then just build it hopefully! If you encounter any problems, please let me know!

Note that there is a compiled Qt translation file `/src/MApRX_Qt/maprx_zh.qm`, which contains (unfinished) Chinese translation for the program, and is compiled as Qt resource into the program. This is for those Chinese friends of mine, and please don't pay much attention on either this file or the translation in the program. I put it there just for the completeness of the source, and I will update it everytime before releasing the program.

Enjoy!
